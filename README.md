# Wanhao-Plus-BLTouch
Wanhao i3 PLUS / Monoprice Maker Select PLUS - Marlin 1.1.3 Configured for BLTouch bed levelling probe and fully functional touch screen. 

This port is of Marlin v 1.1.3 pre-configured for use of BLTouch for bed levelling on the Wanhao i3 PLUS (with touch display) and it's various clones such as the Monoprice Maker Select Plus.
